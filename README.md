# Spectrum Auction 1001 Analysis
Conducting analysis on the reverse side of the FCC's Incentive Auction 
1001. Part of personal research done as a part of Michelle Connolly's 
Spectrum Lab at Duke University.

I aimed to merge winning bid data with census demographic data by DMA to 
find outliers in bidding price and conduct linear regression of winning 
bids on various demographic and geographical data to 
find most significant predictors of eventual bids. I also used residual 
plot analyses to provide insight into the predictive power of the models 
and to better understand outliers. 

Work conducted here is used as the basis for future research on the 
identified outlier bidders and geographical areas to understand potential 
motivating factors. I aim to use this research to 
explore potential monopolistic involvement or malpractice in bidding that 
may come at a detriment to those sharing spectrum access.
